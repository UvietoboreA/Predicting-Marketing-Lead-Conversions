# 🚀 Machine Learning in Action: Predicting Marketing Lead Conversions 🚀  

## 📌 Project Overview  

In this project, I developed **predictive models** to optimize **marketing targeting** for a SaaS platform. The goal? **Predict the likelihood of a marketing lead becoming a customer**, enabling the organization to:  
✅ Reduce marketing spends 📉  
✅ Increase conversions 📈

## 🛠 Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing  
🔹 **Feature Selection & Cleaning**: Removed unnecessary columns and converted revenue data from text to numeric format.  
🔹 **Categorical Encoding**: Transformed categorical features into numerical values using `LabelEncoder` for model compatibility.  
🔹 **Missing Value Imputation**:  
   - **Categorical features**: Filled missing values using **mode**.  
   - **Numerical features**: Imputed missing values with **mean** for consistency.  

### 2️⃣ Modeling & Cross-Validation  
🔹 Built two models:  
   - **RandomForestRegressor** 🌲  
   - **DecisionTreeRegressor** 🌳  
🔹 Applied **cross-validation** with **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** to evaluate performance.  
🔹 Identified the best-performing model for **accurate lead conversion predictions**.  

### 3️⃣ Feature Importance & Predictions  
🔹 **Analyzed feature importance** in the Random Forest model to determine key drivers of lead conversion.  
🔹 **Visualized prediction distributions** and cross-validation scores for insight-driven analysis.  

### 4️⃣ Results Visualization 📊  
🔹 Plotted:  
   - Feature importances  
   - MAE scores across models  
   - Prediction distributions  
🔹 Ensured **actionable insights** are easily interpretable.
